# Analysis of NorthWind Dataset
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The dataset provided is a Microsoft sample dataset representing the sales data of Northwind Traders, a fictional company specialized in the export and import of specialty foods. It served as a valuable resource for me to learn how to import entities from Excel and practice writing queries using the SQL (Structured Query Language). The purpose of this project was to gain proficiency in SQL by working with various SQL keywords such as Joins, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, ROUND, ALTER TABLE, UPDATE, AVG, among others. Through this dataset, I aimed to strengthen my understanding and application of these SQL concepts. For the analysis, I utilized the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), a tool provided by Microsoft specifically designed for working with SQL databases. The Northwind data set comprises seven (7) tables, and there is a data dictionary available that provides detailed information on each column within the dataset.
